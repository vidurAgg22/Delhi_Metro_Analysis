# Delhi Metro Analysis

This project conducts an analysis of the Delhi Metro system using data about its stations, including their locations, lines, opening dates, and layouts. The analysis includes visualizations such as pie charts, bar plots, and maps to provide insights into various aspects of the Delhi Metro.

## Introduction

The code reads data from a CSV file containing information about Delhi Metro stations, including their names, distances from the start, lines, opening dates, layouts, and geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude). It preprocesses the data, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creates visualizations to analyze different aspects of the Delhi Metro system.

## Usage

1. Place the CSV file containing Delhi Metro station data in the same directory as the code.
2. Run the provided code in a Python environment that supports the necessary libraries.
3. The code will preprocess the data, conduct exploratory data analysis, and generate visualizations.
4. Follow the prompts to interact with specific functionalities, such as calculating distances between stations or finding the nearest metro station to a given location.

## File Description

- `delhi_metro_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for analyzing the Delhi Metro system.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.
- `delhimetro.csv`: CSV file containing data about Delhi Metro stations.
- `requirements.txt`: Text file listing the required Python libraries and their versions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- folium
- plotly
- geopy
- ipywidgets
- matplotlib

## Analysis Overview

The analysis includes the following components:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, converting data types, and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing various aspects of the Delhi Metro system, such as the distribution of metro lines, station layouts, and the number of stations opened each year.
3. **Visualization**: Creating visualizations, including pie charts, bar plots, maps, and interactive widgets, to present insights and findings.
4. **Functionality**: Implementing functionalities such as calculating distances between stations and finding the nearest metro station to a given location.
